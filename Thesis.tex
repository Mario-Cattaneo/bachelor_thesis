\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Speculation}
Classifying and regulating speculation on uncertain events has historically been challenging. 
A common classification hinges on the purpose of the speculation,
whether it serves to hedge risk and provide insurance, 
to enable price discovery for information aggregation and forecasting, 
or to function as entertainment akin to gambling.

\subsection{Market Integrity}
This regulatory ambiguity can undermine market integrity through two primary risks: 
direct manipulation and exploitation.

A moral hazard arises when market participants can directly influence an event's outcome. 
Match-fixing in sports provides an illustrative example: 
a boxer might have an economic incentive to lose deliberately if betting returns on their defeat exceed the prize for winning.

A related issue is asymmetric information. 
Not all informational advantages are malicious; 
some are an unavoidable consequence of information diffusion. 
However, the asymmetry becomes exploitative, 
potentially amounting to insider trading, 
when it arises from privileged access that allows a few actors to profit from unfairly obtained information without altering the outcome.

Both risks extend to more severe scenarios, 
from corporate managers taking positions that benefit from a project failure they can influence to insiders profiting from foreknowledge of military actions.

\subsection{Modern Regulation}
To mitigate these risks, 
regulators can prohibit speculation on events that present particularly high moral hazard or exploitation risks. 
For example, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) implements 17 C.F.R. § 40.11, 
which states that a registered entity "shall not list for trading or accept for clearing" contracts that, 
among other things, "involve, relate to, or reference terrorism, assassination, war, gaming, or an activity that is unlawful under any State or Federal law" 
and permits the Commission to identify similar activities it deems contrary to the public interest~\cite{CFTC_REG_40_11}. 
This rule was the primary battleground that Kalshi challenged in order to list specific political prediction markets~\cite{Kalshi_v_CFTC_2024}
and is a primary reason for Polymarket's restricted access for U.S. users~\cite{CFTC_Polymarket_2022}.

\section{Prediction Market Exchanges}
\label{sec:prediction_markets}
Polymarket and Kalshi are two exchanges popularizing prediction markets and making them accessible globally. 
A prediction market is derived from the outcome of a real-world event. 
On both exchanges, a prediction market is exclusively designed for binary events with YES and NO outcomes. 
These outcomes are represented as shares quoted in USD, or on Polymarket specifically, in USDC, 
a USD-backed ERC-20 token managed by Coinbase through a reserve ensuring its value is identical to USD. 
An example is the event ``Will the Republican Party win the House in 2026?'', which is hosted on both exchanges. 
A position in a prediction market refers to a specific quantity of YES or NO shares held. 
The process of deciding the outcome of the underlying event and assigning terminal values for a YES and NO share is called resolution; 
once the values are determined, the market is deemed resolved.

On Kalshi, every YES or NO share is a contract with an expiration date and a central resolution source. 
Kalshi states, ``Each contract is worth \$1 if you're right''~\cite{kalshi_payout}.
Their legally binding rulebook states that the final outcome is decided at their discretion and that contract modifications are possible~\cite{kalshi_rulebook}. 
However, for the purpose of this thesis, we assume that markets can only resolve to either YES or NO.

Polymarket uses the Gnosis Conditional Tokens contract (CTF) to define the YES and NO shares as ERC-1155 tokens and to enforce their combined value at 1 USDC. 
Additionally, it uses UMA's optimistic oracle framework for resolution~\ref{sec:uma}. 
In this system, a prediction can resolve to UNKNOWN, rendering the value of YES and NO shares 0.5 USDC each~\ref{sec:uca}.

In both cases, the combined value of a YES and NO share for a prediction is exactly 1 USD at all times, 
as enforced by the trading contract on Kalshi and by the CTF smart contract on Polymarket~\ref{sec:CTF}. 
This does not hold for the market prices of the YES and NO shares on the exchange, 
which are determined by a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) on both exchanges~\ref{chap:orderbook_trading}. 
This discrepancy is what makes internal market arbitrage possible.

Events with more than two discrete outcomes can be constructed using multiple prediction markets. 
For example, the event ``Which party will win the House in 2026?'' is decomposed into prediction markets for the questions 
``Will the Democratic Party win the House in 2026?'' and ``Will the Republican Party win the House in 2026?''. 
This provides powerful information aggregation capabilities built on top of the information efficiency of markets. 
A common pattern on both exchanges is to define an event with more than two possible discrete outcomes exhaustively, 
using a separate prediction market for each mutually exclusive outcome. 
The event ``Which party will win the House in 2026?'' is an example of this. 
Polymarket labels these as \textit{Negrisk} and provides a full suite of smart contracts dedicated to these events, 
including a distinct settlement smart contract deployment \textit{Negrisk CTFE} and an atomic swap operation for converting 
a set of mutually exclusive outcome positions into the complementary positions of the alternative outcomes~\ref{sec:nr}.

    \label{fig:KALSHI_QUARTERLY_TRADES}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:POLY_QUARTERLY_TRADES} and~\ref{fig:KALSHI_QUARTERLY_TRADES} show the quarterly USD trading volume. For Polymarket, we can also distinguish between trading volume on the Negrisk CTFE and the Basic CTFE~\ref{sec:ctfe}. 

\subsection{US Market}
The flat line in Polymarket's trading volume starts right after the CFTC action in January 2022. Kalshi operated only in the U.S. until October 2025, covering the first three quarters of 2025 and the last quarter of 2024 shown in Figure~\ref{fig:KALSHI_QUARTERLY_TRADES}.

The 47th U.S. presidential election was a major event for both exchanges. Various studies have compared the forecasting ability and information efficiency of Kalshi and Polymarket for this event against other methods like New York Times polls~\cite{clinton2025prediction,wolfers2024prediction}. The volume spike in the fourth quarter of 2024 is also clearly visible. On Kalshi, markets related to politics and the election accounted for roughly 1 billion USD in volume in November alone~\cite{morningstar2024kalshi}. On Polymarket, the main market for the presidential election accumulated a total volume of 3.5 billion USDC~\cite{coindesk2024polymarket}.

However, a recent study using two unsupervised network models suggests that around 18\% or less of the volume traded on Polymarket is wash trading, where users trade with themselves to inflate activity. One method reported that approximately 60\% of the December 2024 volume was washed~\cite{WashTrading}. This occurred the month after the U.S. election markets concluded and coincided with a decline of over 50\% in total trading volume~\cite{duneNovDec}.

\subsection{Accessibility}
Kalshi expanded to over 140 countries in October 2025~\cite{kalshi2025expansion}, and Polymarket plans to reenter the U.S. market. On July 21, 2025, Polymarket acquired QCX LLC, a company that had registered as a Designated Contract Market (DCM) with the CFTC earlier that month~\cite{GCX_ACQUIRY}. This entity was subsequently rebranded as ``Polymarket US''~\cite{GCX_CFTC_REGISTRY}. As of December 4, 2025, Polymarket was not yet available in the U.S. Both exchanges face regulatory headwinds in many jurisdictions. Gambling authorities in several countries have banned them. This includes Switzerland, where the Swiss Gambling Supervisory Authority (GESPA) has blacklisted their DNS domains, blocking access via Swiss ISPs~\cite{GESPA_BLACKLIST}.

Despite CFTC approval, Kalshi faces state-level regulatory issues in the U.S. For example, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) issued a cease-and-desist order preventing Kalshi from operating in Illinois for allegedly defying state gambling regulations. Kalshi argues that national oversight by the CFTC preempts these claims. This ongoing case demonstrates that the regulatory landscape surrounding speculation remains conflicted~\cite{kalshi2025illinois}.

Polymarket remains accessible by design, even where banned, because it does not require Know-Your-Customer (KYC) identification on its main platform. Even if KYC were enforced, users could still interact with the underlying smart contracts directly. The ERC-1155 tokens representing YES or NO shares are defined by the Gnosis Conditional Tokens contract. These can be obtained via \textit{splitPosition}, swapped for USDC via \textit{mergePosition}, and redeemed after resolution using \textit{redeemPosition} for the value reported by Polymarket.

\chapter{Objective and Methodology}
The first objective was to design a data collection client for Polymarket's off-chain endpoints. 
The second objective was to analyze the market lifecycle on Polymarket.
The third objective was to analyze slippage on Polymarket and prediction market arbitrage.

\section{Methodology}
Both Polymarket and Kalshi provide WebSocket endpoints to subscribe to orderbook state changes and trades, 
as well as HTTP endpoints to request the orderbook state. 
To use these endpoints, the orderbooks of interest must first be identified. 
For this, both exchanges define market objects and provide HTTP endpoints to query historical data, 
as well as WebSocket endpoints to subscribe to market lifecycle events. 
Both exchanges use JSON for endpoint communication and define rate limits for request throughput. 

Due to Polymarket's sparse documentation, significant information had to be discovered through testing and response analysis. 
These findings, along with continuous endpoint changes and discovered state inconsistencies, 
resulted in multiple client iterations. 
The final clients are tailored for the events ``Which party will win the House in 2026?'' and the cyclical 15‑minute event ``Bitcoin up or down?''.
This is covered in Chapter~\ref{chap:endpoints}.

To analyze the market lifecycle, 
Chapter~\ref{chap:smart_contracts} first examines the statically available information from on‑chain smart contracts. 
This includes essential smart contract control flow, emitted events, and immutable contract storage. 
These elements allow for establishing links between contracts and their intended use, 
and they help identify details that can only be deduced from emitted events. 
For this purpose, a client for the Infura \textit{eth\_getLogs} endpoint was implemented.
These events and the historical market objects, retrieved through Polymarket's endpoints, 
are then used to analyze market lifecycle coordination in Chapter~\ref{chap:market_lifecycle}.

In Chapter~\ref{chap:orderbook_trading}, the orderbook for prediction markets is formalized to define how slippage and arbitrage are measured.
Then, data collected from Polymarket's and Kalshi's endpoints, along with emitted events, are used to analyze slippage and arbitrage using these measures.

Finally, Chapter~\ref{chap:discussion} discusses and interprets the findings of this thesis.

\chapter{Endpoints and Clients}
\label{chap:endpoints}

\section{Polymarket Event and Market Endpoints}
\label{sec:clob_json}
Polymarket defines a market object for every prediction market, identified by a unique market ID. 
Every market is part of an \textit{event}, and every event can be associated with multiple \textit{tags}. 
The \textit{gamma-api.polymarket.com} domain hosts several HTTP endpoints to query market, event, or tag objects using pagination. 
The documentation provides only an example use case, a list of query parameters, and a sample request and response. 

The most essential query parameters are \textit{offset} and \textit{limit}, which enable batch access. 
The limit specifies the number of objects in a batch, while the offset determines the starting point. 
This implicitly assumes an ordered list of objects starting at offset zero. 
An \textit{order} parameter also exists but lacks detailed specification. 
Testing revealed that sorting by many attributes fails to order the results correctly, omits markets, or returns duplicates at different offsets. 
Querying event objects ordered by event ID avoids these anomalies and was recently added as an example in the documentation. 
However, ordering market objects by ID is not possible. 

Testing also revealed an undocumented constraint: the limit parameter is capped at 500. 
Any value exceeding this simply returns 500 objects starting at the specified offset. 
Before December 2025, the response behavior for requesting an offset beyond the available range was unspecified. 
It was eventually clarified in December 2025 that such requests return an empty JSON array.

\subsection{Event and Market Objects}
The market object is listed with over 100 attributes in the documentation. 
Initial testing showed a mismatch between the attributes in actual responses and those listed in the documentation; 
furthermore, the attributes vary between responses. 
For this reason, this analysis covers all event objects (which include associated market and tag objects) obtained from the \textit{events} endpoint.

Since JSON is specified by a deterministic context-free language, it can be parsed unambiguously into a tree of nodes, where every node has a type. 
For every event object, a tree is constructed where every node (except the root) is a child of either an object or an array. 
If a node is a child of an object, it must have an associated string key. 
A node is a leaf if it is an empty array, an empty object, or a scalar type (number, string, boolean, or null). 

For a more representative type analysis, numbers are further categorized as IEEE 754 floating-point values or integers. 
Strings are classified as empty, whitespace-only, JSON-encoded, standardized timestamps, numeric strings, hexadecimal, case-insensitive literals (``null'', ``none'', ``nan'', ``true'', ``false''), or \textit{general} strings. 
The resulting table showing the type distribution and occurrence frequency for every tree path is available in Appendix~\ref{tab:json_tree_analysis_multiline}.

\section{Polymarket Orderbook and Trade Endpoints}
Polymarket provides a \textit{book} HTTP endpoint to request the current orderbook state under the \textit{clob.polymarket.com} domain. 
It also provides a \textit{market} WebSocket endpoint to receive state change events under the \textit{\seqsplit{ws-subscriptions-clob.polymarket.com}} domain, referred to as the \textit{market feed}. 
Every prediction market is associated with two orderbooks: one for the YES outcome and one for the NO outcome. 
An orderbook has a side for buying the underlying outcome token (bids) and a side for selling the underlying outcome token (asks). 
The orderbook's underlying outcome is uniquely identified by a \textit{token ID}, also referred to as an \textit{asset ID}. 
Every market object contains two asset IDs within a JSON-encoded string array under the key ``clobTokenIds''~\ref{tab:json_tree_analysis_multiline}.

\subsection{Book Endpoint}
\label{sec:missing}
The specification for the book endpoint consists only of a list of request and response JSON attributes, along with samples for both. 
This endpoint returns the orderbook state objects for the requested asset IDs. 
The documentation does not specify the maximum number of asset IDs that can be requested, the limit on returned orderbooks, or the behavior when requesting the orderbook of an already resolved market. 
Testing revealed that orderbook states are returned in the order requested. 
However, any orderbook state object requested for an asset ID whose market is already resolved is omitted from the response. 
Additionally, the response contains at most 500 orderbook state objects.

The orderbook state object shown in Appendix~\ref{lst:orderbook_state} is based on the sample provided in Polymarket's documentation. 
Notably, the timestamp attribute is described as a string but appears in responses as a string representation of a Unix millisecond timestamp.

\subsection{Falsely Missing Orderbook State Objects}
An initial client making concurrent requests to the book endpoint revealed an anomaly where the endpoint failed to return orderbook state objects for specific asset IDs, only to include them in subsequent responses. 
This effectively made the orderbook state unavailable, mimicking a resolved market. 
Crucially, this was not caused by rate limiting, as the endpoint did not return error status codes. 

The same setup was run for several hours using strictly serialized requests, and this anomaly was not detected. 
To investigate further, every asset ID was mapped to a \textit{false miss} counter. 
This counter incremented whenever the orderbook state object for a requested asset ID was missing from the response; 
if the object appeared, the counter was reset to 0.

This experiment revealed an initial burst of false misses for many asset IDs, though the counts remained below 13. 
After this initial burst, the number of asset IDs experiencing false misses decreased significantly, but the reported miss counts showed much larger variance, with some exceeding 1,000 false misses.

\subsection{Market Feed}
The market feed broadcasts event messages for subscribed markets. 
Prior to December 17, 2025, this endpoint allowed only a single subscription per established WebSocket connection. 
Consequently, if any markets were resolved or created, a new WebSocket connection had to be established to adapt to the change. 
This limitation was undocumented; testing simply revealed that sending more than one subscription message stopped all event delivery. 
Even with a 30-second timeout, the server kept the underlying persistent TCP and WebSocket connection alive without sending further messages, effectively turning it into a zombie connection.

On December 17, dynamic subscription and unsubscription messages were announced via Discord, confirming that this functionality was previously unavailable. 
This was a significant improvement, as the prior client required a new WebSocket connection whenever new markets were created. 
Another major improvement occurred around January 5, 2026, when lifecycle updates were added to the market feed. 
Previously, the market or events endpoint had to be scraped continuously to check for new or resolved markets, introducing unnecessary latency and complexity. 
Comparing market objects from a long-lived connection (continuously scraped for lifecycle changes) against a separate, one-time exhaustive scrape revealed that some market objects were never returned at any offset on the market endpoint for the long-lived connection. 
This anomaly was only measurable after three days.

Unlike the book, market, and event endpoints, the market feed's documented response attributes appear in every response and are of the correct type. 
Sample messages can be found in the Appendix: ~\ref{lst:price_change_event} for price changes, ~\ref{lst:book_event} for book events, ~\ref{lst:trade_event} for trade events, ~\ref{lst:new_market} for new market events, and ~\ref{lst:market_res} for market resolved events. 
However, the last trade price event contains an undocumented attribute \textit{tx\_hash} of type string, which is always a hexadecimal value with the length of an Ethereum transaction hash. 
The timestamps for market feed events are string representations of Unix millisecond timestamps, matching those found in the book endpoint responses. 
However, because timestamps only have millisecond resolution and there are no other attributes to order events, the state becomes ambiguous when multiple conflicting events occur within the same millisecond.

\subsection{Ambiguous Event Ordering}
The most obvious conflict arises between events of the same type occurring at the same millisecond with different resulting states. 
For price change events, this occurs when two or more events share the same timestamp, side, price, and asset ID, but have different sizes. 
In such cases, it is unclear what the exact size is at the given price, side, and asset ID at or after that timestamp. 
Book events conflict if they share the same timestamp and asset ID but list different bids and asks. 
Similarly, last trade events conflict when they share the same timestamp, asset ID, side, and price, making it impossible to differentiate which trade was filled at which size. 
Table~\ref{tab:market_analysis} illustrates that this occurs in practice.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Bitcoin Up or Down - January 7, 11:00AM-11:15AM ET}
\label{tab:market_analysis}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Message Type} & \textbf{Total} & \textbf{Ambiguous (\%)} & \textbf{Duplicate (\%)} \\
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{|l|}{\textbf{Asset ID:} 113615...8317859} \\
\hline
Last Trade Prices & 3,562 & 24 (0.67\%) & 0 (0.0\%) \\
\hline
Price Changes & 158,662 & 3,228 (2.04\%) & 1,336 (0.84\%) \\
\hline
Books & 6,074 & 0 (0.0\%) & 0 (0.0\%) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

If we additionally consider the ambiguity arising when a price change message and a book summary message share the same timestamp (i.e., it is unclear whether the price change applied before or after the book state summary), we find that 7,160 price changes are ambiguous.

\section{Final Polymarket Client}
The initial client was designed to subscribe to the market feed and make orderbook state requests for all existing unresolved markets. 
This involved over 30,000 orderbooks. 
Since only 500 orderbooks can be requested at once, there is a clear trade-off between the number of orderbooks monitored and the frequency of updates. 
Additionally, since market feed events cannot be unambiguously ordered, frequent requests for the actual orderbook state become even more valuable. 
For these reasons, the final client was designed to monitor fewer than 500 orderbooks and request their states sequentially, with a minimum interval of 500ms between requests. 
The documentation specifies a rate limit of 500 requests/s, so this setup is very conservative. 
For the event ``Which party will win the House in 2026?'', there are four orderbooks, while the cyclical 15-minute event ``Bitcoin up or down?'' typically has fewer than 100 active orderbooks.

The final client initially scrapes the events endpoint for all currently available 15-minute cyclical ``Bitcoin up or down?'' markets. 
It then subscribes to the market feed using these IDs and the four known orderbooks from ``Which party will win the House in 2026?''. 
It also listens for newly created or resolved ``Bitcoin up or down?'' markets to dynamically manage subscriptions. 
The client also initiates the orderbook state requests as specified above and persistently stores the price change, book, last trade price events, and orderbook state objects in a database.

\section{Kalshi Endpoints}
\label{sec:kalshi_endpoints}
Kalshi provides endpoints similar to those on Polymarket. 
These include the \textit{events} endpoint for scraping any market ever created and a WebSocket endpoint with different channels, such as \textit{trades}, \textit{orderbook updates}, and \textit{market lifecycle}. 
Markets are uniquely identified through their \textit{market\_ticker}. 
These tickers allow for dynamic subscription and unsubscription for the channels of interest on the WebSocket endpoint.

However, unlike Polymarket, Kalshi provides a single orderbook for both outcomes of a prediction market. 
One side represents the YES prices and the other the NO prices, as seen in the documented orderbook delta~\ref{lst:orderbook_delta} and orderbook snapshot~\ref{lst:orderbook_snapshot} responses. 
Other documented responses are available in the Appendix: ~\ref{lst:event_object} for event objects, ~\ref{lst:market_lifecycle_event} for market lifecycle events, and ~\ref{lst:trade_update} for trade updates.

The JSON objects within the messages sent by the orderbook update and trade channels contain a unique integer sequence identifier. 
This identifier can be used to unambiguously order the events for a given channel and spot any missing events, as the first event after subscription has sequence identifier zero, and each subsequent event increments the identifier by one. 
Although Kalshi's documentation for the trade update message is missing the \textit{seq} attribute, the messages effectively contain it. 
However, ordering trade events relative to orderbook events remains ambiguous, as it relies on timestamps that are only specified in seconds for trades.

\section{Kalshi Client}
Due to the sequence identifiers provided by Kalshi, there is no need to additionally request the orderbook state, as the identifiers allow for unambiguous maintenance of the orderbook state. 
The Kalshi client therefore functions similarly to the Polymarket client, but without the need for periodic orderbook state requests.


\chapter{Smart Contracts}
\label{chap:smart_contracts}
Polymarket has a dedicated github account with over 90 repositories. There are many individual repositories containing the solidity source for smart contracts and their deployment status. They also have a dedicated repository which lists any deployment address that seemingly can be found elsewhere, the associated contract and a security audit, if present~\cite{polyDepList}. It is not explicitly mentioned if it is an exhaustive list, but at least looking through the entire documentation on the website and all repositories on github, does not reveal any undeclared deployment, since there is no other authorative source overriding this, it will be used as the reference of the disclosed deployments.

\section{Conditional Tokens}
\label{sec:CTF}
The Gnosis Conditional Tokens contract (CTF) extends the ERC-1155 standard, utilizing it to construct tokens representing the outcomes of an event or condition. This enables transferring, minting, and burning multiple outcome tokens within a single transaction.

The contract defines the relationship between the value of the n outcome tokens $(O_1, \dots, O_n)$ for an event and the ERC-20 collateral token $Q$ as:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:rule1}
    Q = \sum_{i=1}^{n} O_i
\end{align}

\noindent The \textit{splitPositions} method atomically swaps an amount $n$ of collateral $Q$ for $n$ units of each outcome token and emits the \textit{PositionSplit} event. The \textit{mergePositions} method performs the reverse atomic swap and emits the \textit{PositionsMerge} event.

Before these methods can be utilized, the condition must be prepared using the \textit{prepareConditions} method with an oracle address, a question ID, and an outcome count. This emits the \textit{ConditionPreparation} event. Every condition is assigned a unique identifier defined as:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:cond_id}
    condition_{id} := keccak(oracle \parallel question_{id} \parallel \text{outcome count})
\end{align}

\noindent Subsequently, only the oracle can report the payouts using the \textit{reportPayouts} method by passing an array of unsigned integers $payouts = (p_1, ..., p_n)$ for the $n$ outcome tokens respectively. This emits the \textit{ConditionResolution} event and assigns each outcome token $O_i$ a value new value:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:rule2}
    O_i := Q \cdot \frac{p_i}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k}
\end{align}
After this assigment we still have that \eqref{eq:rule1} holds. 

Finally, after the payout is reported, anyone can redeem the outcome tokens they own for the value assigned to them in \eqref{eq:rule2} using the \textit{redeemPositions} method, which emits the \textit{PayoutRedemption} event.

\section{UMA framework}
\label{sec:uma}
UMA designs protocols for oracles and deploys ethereum based contracts on various block chains like polygon. These deployments are connected to UMAs dedicated web application, which is allows users actively to participate in solving price requests.

Polymarket exclusively used UMAs OptimisticOracleV2 (OOV2) deployment up until August 2025, where the UMIP-189 governance proposal passed and UMA deployed a ManagedOptimisticOracleV2 (MOOV2) dedicated only for Polymarket usage. The ManagedOptimisticOracleV2 is based on the same protocol, but with additional access control configurations~\cite{UMIP189}.

Polymarket atomically sets the requested prices to be event based in its UmaCtfAdapter contract. 
Which starts with a price request.
This emits the \textit{RequestPrice} event. 
For a price request to be settled, 
the effective price must first be determined, 
this requires an initial price proposal to be made by suggesting a price for the request. 
This emits the \textit{ProposePrice} event. 
After a price proposal is made, the price can be disputed within the liveness period which by default is two hours. 
If the proposal remains undisputed during this period, 
then it becomes the effective price for the request and the request can be settled.
Both the proposals and disputes have no access control in OOV2.
If the proposal is disputed, the \textit{DisputePrice} event is emitted and then a stake based voting process starts. 
The contract for this is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and therefore involves an off chain coordinated message relayer.
After the price is determined the request can be settled, to reward or slash the proposer and disputer if existent, 
depending on the correctness of their proposals compared to the final outcome. 
This emits the \textit{Settle} event.

The OOV2 does not specify what the prices exactly mean. 
So in the context of Polymarket the ancillary data has to formally specify semantic meaning of the integer price values. 
Polymarket does not explicitly state this, but analyzing the emitted events shows that virtually all ancillary data extends the UMIP-107 standard, 
such that the requested price identifier is \textit{YES\_OR\_NO\_QUERY} and the ancillary data is a utf-8 encoded dictionary, 
which specifies the question using the \textit{q:}, the associated market by the \textit{market id}  key and the 4 possible prices through the 
\textit{p1:}, \textit{p2:}, \textit{p3:} and \textit{p4:} keys. 
Which specify which price is mapped to the outcomes \textit{YES}, \textit{NO}, \textit{UNKNOWN} and \textit{EARLY PROPOSAL} ~\cite{UMIP107}.

\section{UmaCtfAdapter}
\label{sec:uca}
This is Polymarkets custom contract, 
built on top of the CTF and OOV2,
which it stores as immutable references by address. 
It provides an \textit{initialize} which atomically prepares the condition on the CTF, using itself as an oracle and a hard coded outcome slot count of two, and also makes the price request to the OOV2.
The \textit{initialize} method is permissionless and emits the \textit{QuestionInitialized} event. 
The other permissionless method \textit{resolve}, emitting the \textit{QuestionResolved} event, can only be invoked if the markets requested price has been determined and it is not paused. 
It calls the OOV2 to settle and get the \textit{int256} price and if the price is not that of the \textit{EARLY PROPOSAL} outcome then uses this price to report the payouts in the CTF. 
The \textit{EARLY PROPOSAL} outcome is hard coded as the least \textit{int256} value for comparison, a price of 0 is considered as \textit{NO}, a price of 0.5 Ether is considered as \textit{UNKNOWN}, 
any other price is considered \textit{YES}.
If the outcome is \textit{NO} then the payout array passed to the CTF is [0,1], if the outcome is \textit{UNKNOWN} then the it is [1,1] and otherwise it is [1,0] for the outcome \textit{YES}.

The rest of the public methods in this contract all have access restricted to either \textit{onlyAdmin} or \textit{onlyOracle}.
This also includes the \textit{resolveManually} method which directly reports the payouts array passed without settling any price request.

\section{CTFExchange}
\label{sec:ctfe}
The CTFExchange is another custom contract by Polymarket it provides the \textit{matchOrders} method used for settling a match on the CLOB between a taker order and $n$ maker orders and emits one \textit{OrdersMatched} event, and $n+1$ \textit{OrderFilled} events. 
One OrderFilled event is for the taker facing the exchange and the other $n$ are for the makers facing the taker. There are three types of matches; split, merge and complementary.
A split match is when the taker and maker are both buyers, one for YES shares and the other for NO shares. 
Analogously, a merge match is when the taker and maker are both sellers, one for YES shares and the other for NO shares.
When the taker is selling the shares the maker is buying, or vice versa, then it is a complementary match.
The match type and also the amount of the instruments exchanged can be deduced from the order filled events.


\section{Negrisk}
\label{sec:nr}
The Negrisk framework builds on top of the UmaCtfAdpater to create multiple markets with mutually exclusive outcomes and thereby provide the \textit{convertPositions} method, which enables atomically swapping a set YES shares to the complementary set of NO shares or vice versa. This is implemented in the Negrisk Adapter, but the framework also entails a Negrisk Operator, which is used by the Negrisk UmaCtfAdapter as immutable reference for the conditional tokens contract interface, but the Negrisk Operators conditions prepared method does literally nothing and its reportPayouts method does not call any other contract, but it has other public methods which relay to the adapter, which actually references the CTF. Additionally a dedicated Negrisk CTFExchange deployment exists, which is simply another instance of the CTFExchange contract.

\todo{figure for immutable deployment references}

\section{Polygon Collection}
\label{sec:polygon_collection}
The polygon collection is tailored for the Infura eth\_getLogs endpoint. Infura has a rate limit of 500 credits/s, with a request to the eth\_getLogs requiring 255 credits according the documentation. 
However, testing showed that the actual rate limit between requests without getting rate limited is more around 1s. 
The rtt for a single eth\_getLogs request can be over 30s long, which is why its suited for concurrent requests. 
Besides the request frequency, there also is limit of 10'000 events that can requested. 
But the request is specified using a block range. For this purpose we can use alpha estimation with a margin 500 to converge to the block density for requesting the block expected to return 9'500 events. 
This seems to be effective as for most events the block density does not seem to have strong variance. 
But the margin can be increased if some events have a greater block density variance. 
As a sanity check the amount of events returned have been compared to the amount of events returned to that found in dune over the same block range. 
The full list of collectected events can be found int the appendix ~\ref{tab:contract_events_vertical}


\chapter{Market Lifecycle}
\label{chap:market_lifecycle}
To analyze the ma block numbers 79172086 inclusive and 81225971 inclusive, which is November 18th 2025 7:00:03 UTC to January 5th 2026 00:00:01 UTC, from polygon through the Infura client specified in ~\ref{sec:polygon_collection} and historically fetchable market objects on Polymarkets endpoints we can analyze the market lifecycle.
\section {Market Creation}
\subsection{Reporting Oracles}
\label{sec:reporting_oracles}
In section ~\ref{sec:CTF} we saw that the reporting oracle for a condition is passed as an argument for condition preparation on the CTF, and is the only address which can report payouts for the final YES and NO share value after resolution. 
Which is why it is essential to analyze which the reporting oracles being used by Polymarket.

Out of the 128'003 ConditionPreparation events, 124'340 have a matching off chain market object with the same condition id.
These matched ConditionPreparation events have three distinct reporting oracles, two of which are are not documented. 
Namely the \textit{MOOV2 Adapter} and \textit{Centralized Adapter} in Appendix ~\ref{tab:contracts_deployment}.

The MOOV2 Adapter is an UmaCtfAdapter instance described in section ~\ref{sec:uca}. 
The MOOV2 Adapter uses the MOOV2 instead of the OOV2.
Interestingly, no condition has been prepared with the Basic Adapter as reporting oracle. This aligns with the umip-189 proposal and suggests that the MOOV2 Adapter replaced the Basic Adapter,
even though Polymarket has not disclosed anything on this matter.

\begin{figure}[H] 
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{figures/clob_cft_cdf.png}
    \caption{Cumulative count of conditions found over time}
    \label{fig:clob_cft_cdf}
\end{figure}

In figure ~\ref{fig:clob_cft_cdf} we can see that around December 17th 2025 some market objects start to appear without an acceptingOrders timestamp, 
as can also be seen in the appendix ~\ref{tab:json_tree_analysis_multiline}.
Additionally, this is where the 3'663 conditions were prepared on the CTF with no matching off chain market object, 
out of which virtually all use the Centralized Adapter as reporting oracle, 
which also had a change in the rate at which new conditions were prepared with it as reporting oracle.

\subsection{Centralized Adapter}
The bytecode for the Centralized Adapter is not recognized by prominent bytecode to source indexers like Polygonscan or Etherscan.
However, we can still use the matched market objects to analyze this adapter more in depth.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Label frequency in 41'016 market objects matched with Centralized Adapter as reporting oracle}
    \label{tab:centralized_adapter_events}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Label} & \textbf{Appeared in (\%)} \\
        \hline
        Up or Down & 41,016 (100\%) \\
        \hline
        Crypto Prices & 41,016 (100\%)  \\
        \hline
        Hide From New & 41,016 (100\%)  \\
        \hline
        Recurring & 41,016 (100\%)  \\
        \hline
        Crypto & 41,016 (100\%)  \\
        \hline
        5M & 21,630 (52.7\%) \\
        \hline
        15M & 18,270 (44.5\%) \\
        \hline
        Solana & 10,263 (25.0\%) \\
        \hline
        Ethereum & 10,257 (25.0\%) \\
        \hline
        XRP & 10,256 (25.0\%) \\
        \hline
        Ripple & 10,256 (25.0\%) \\
        \hline
        Bitcoin & 10,240 (25.0\%) \\
        \hline
        4H & 1'116 (2.7\%) \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Every market object has a set of labels assigned by polymarket to categorize the event. 
Table ~\ref{tab:centralized_adapter_events} shows the frequency of all labels in market objects matched with the conditions prepared with the Centralized Adapter as reporting oracle. 
Clearly, all labels are tied to crypto asset price related events. 
If we look up individual matched markets on polymarkets web application, 
we find that none of them have a link to the UMA resolution status on the UMA webapplication, which for other markets exists. 
Instead they link to a source which tracks the underlying crypto asset price, which is directly used as the ground truth for resolution.
An example for this are the cyclical 15 minute ``Bitcoin up or down?'' markets.



\subsection{Resolution Source}
Whilst the MOOV2 Adapter makes a price request atomically with the condition preparation through the initialize method, 
a condition prepared for a Negrisk does not atomically make a price request and condition preparation atomically unless some hidden method is used for this, 
as explained in section ~\ref{sec:nr}.
The ConditionPreparation events and RequestPrice events have nothing that can be used to match them directly. 
However, virtually every Ancillary data contains a market id key, which can be used to match price requests to market objects and then to ConditionPreparation events.
Out of the 84,684 RequestPrice events, 83,743 have a matching off-chain market object and 83,652 have a matching ConditionPreparation.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Resolution Source and Reporting Oracle Pairs}
    \label{tab:oracle_makeup2}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Resolution Source (ids)} & \textbf{Matches} & \textbf{Oracle (Conditions)}\\
        \hline
        MOOV2 & 57'502 & MOOV2 Adapter \\
        \hline
        OOV2 & 70 & MOOV2 Adapter \\
        \hline
        OOV2 & 26'080 & Negrisk Adapter \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

A curious anomaly is that 70 out of the price requests made to the OOV2 matched with conditions prepared using the MOOV2 Adapter as reporting oracle, 
and 50 out of the requests made to the OOV2 matched with the MOOV2 Adapter as reporting oracle do not share the same tranaction hash and are therefor not atomically executed using the initialize method.

The conditions prepared with the Negrisk Adapter as reporting oracle matched exclusively with price requests made to the OOV2. Out of these matches non share the same transaction hash, 
which means they are not executed atomically, but 21,672 (83.10\%) share the same block number, 
which demonstrates that they mostly are executed in a timely manner, but coordinated through separate transactions.


\section{Exchange Registration}
\label{sec:ctfe_c}
For matched orders on the CLOB to be settled on the on-chain exchange, first the condition id and two token ids of the prediction market must be registered as explained in section ~\ref{sec:ctfe}. 

\begin{figure}[H] 
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{figures/reg_clob.png}
    \caption{CLOB markets and registered tokens unique condito}
    \label{fig:reg_clob}
\end{figure}

In figure ~\ref{fig:reg_clob} we can see after some point in time, markets are consistently being created without being registered with the on chain exchange.
This happens around the same time at which market objects start being created without acceptingOrder timestamps.

\subsection{Unregistered Traded Outcomes}
If we match the ConditionsPrepared events to the RegisteredToken events, 
we find that virtually all unregistered markets were prepared using the Centralized Adapter as reporting oracle, 
Additionally, less than half of the conditions are registered. 

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Matched conditions of 134,424 Conditions Prepared and 215,152 TokensRegistered over Nov 18 - Jan 08}
    \label{tab:oracle_regs}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Oracle (Conditions)} & \textbf{Matches} & \textbf{Exchange (Conditions)}\\
        \hline
        Centralized Adapter (48'896) & 20'425 & CTFE (83'262) \\
        \hline
        MOOV2 Adapter (62'857) & 61'439 & CTFE (83'262) \\
        \hline
        Negrisk Adapter (27'728) & 23'545 & Negrisk CTFE (24'209)\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Strangely, there are provably markets, which are visible on the web application, listed as active in the market object and have trade events being sent out on the websocket market feed, 
but do not have any registered token events nor orders matched or order filled events emitted from neither the CTFE nor Negrisk CTFE. 
An example for this, are some of the 15 minute cyclical ``bitcoin up or down?'' markets.

\section{Resolution}
\subsection{Disputes}
As described in section ~\ref{sec:uma} the UMA OOV2 and MOOV2 protocol allows for price proposals to be disputed within a liveness period. 
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Ten Most Frequent Tags in Matched Disputes}
    \label{tab:top10_disputes}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|}

        \hline

        \hline
        Sports & 74 (22.77\%) \\
        \hline
        Games & 72 (22.15\%) \\
        \hline
        Hide From New & 49 (15.08\%) \\
        \hline
        Recurring & 45 (13.85\%) \\

        \hline
        Geopolitics & 39 (12.00\%) \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

There are a total of 74,833 matched propsals and 340 matched disputes. 
Table ~\ref{tab:top10_disputes} shows the ten most frequent labels assigned to the markets objects matched with the disputes.
Out of the 340 matched disputes, 145 are on the OOV2 and 195 on the MOOV2.
This is ironic, because according to the umip-189 proposal, the MOOV2 was explicitly designed with a propososer whitelist, 
which Polymarket manages. Yet, the MOOV2 has more disputes than the OOV2. 
However, its important to note that the MOOV2 also has 53,818 proposals, 
compared to the OOV2 which has 21,015 proposals.

\subsection{Reported Unkown Outcome}
The terminal value for the YES and NO shares is determined by the payout array passed from the reporting oracle to the CTF,
which emits a ConditionResolution event, containing the condition id and the payout array.
Out of 112'638 ConditionResolution events, 283 (0.25\%) reported an Unknown outcome, 
46,373 (41.17\%) reported a YES outcome and 66,982 (58.58\%) reported a NO outcome.
If the YES and NO outcomes were uniformly distributed, we would expect them to be reported equally, 
but most negrisk events are designed to have one prediction market resolve to YES and the rest to NO.
In fact out of the 19'541 ConditionResolution events with a Negrisk Adapter as reporting oracle, only 2,616 (13.39\%) reported a YES outcome, 
16,925 (86.61\%) reported a NO outcome and none reported an UNKNOWN outcome. 
All of the UNKNOWN outcomes were reported by the MOOV2 Adapter.
\begin{table}[H]

        \hline
        Tennis & 29 (10.25\%) \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table ~\ref{tab:top10_tags_1_1} shows what kind of labels are associated with markets reported to have an UNKNOWN outcome.


\subsection{Manual Resolutions}
In sections ~\ref{sec:manual_resolutions} it was mentioned that the UmaCtfAdapter and Negrisk Operator have administrative methods, which can be used to manually resolve markets without UMA price requests being settled.
All of the relevant methods emit events, including the \textit{resolveMarketManually} method in the UmaCtfAdapter and the \textit{emergencyResolveQuestion} method in the Negrisk Operator. 
However, there no events for either of these methods was emitted in any of the UmaCtfAdapter instances or the single Negrisk Operator instance.
This does not fully exclude the possibility of manual resolution, but if this is the case, then it must be done through a delegate call from a hidden proxy contract,
such that the events are emitted from the proxy contract.

\chapter{Orderbook and Trading}
\label{chap:orderbook_trading}
In section ~\ref{sec:prediction_markets} we explained how a prediction market consists of YES and NO shares whos price is denoted in USD.
The CLOB used by Polymarket and Kalshi captures the intention of traders through market and limit orders,
which are placed through HTTPS requests to \textit{order} endpoints and are matched based on price-time priority ~\cite{}.
A limit order allows the trader to specify price at which they want to buy or sell shares, but this price can not cross other resting limit orders, 
otherwise is becomes marketable. 
A marketable order is either executed immediately against the best possible resting limit orders by price-time priority, or is aborted ~\cite{}.

\section{State, Ordering and Matching}
\label{sec:CLOB_state}

A trader can either buy or sell YES or NO shares, which creates four possible orders; Sell Yes, Sell No, Buy Yes, Buy No. 
However, among these four orders there are only two intentions, which are either to speculate on the YES outcome by buying YES shares or selling NO shares, 
or to speculate on the NO outcome by buying NO shares or selling YES shares.

Kalshi maintains a single orderbook for each prediction market, which captures the order intentions through a YES and NO side.
Polymarket on the other hand documents and provides separate orderbooks for the YES and NO shares, with bid and ask sides.
However, analyzing the state of the orderbook, reveals that the bid share amount at any given price $p$ for the YES shares 
are always the same as the same as the the ask share amount for the NO shares at price $1-p$. 
The analogous also holds for the YES asks and NO bids.

The state of the CLOB can be defined through the resting limit orders.
A limit order can be defined as a tuple $(p, v, s, i)$, where $p \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is the price for an outcome share, $v \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is the quantity of the shares, $s \in \{\text{YES}, \text{NO}\}$ is the outcome and $i \in \mathbb{N}$ is the priority it has to be selected for matching with market orders at price $p$ and side $s$, a lower $i$ has a higher priority. 
This guarantees a unique ordering for both buy and sell limit orders which is used for matching. 
Formally, for limit orders we have that:

\begin{align}
\label{eq:sales_ordering}
    & ((p_1, v_1, s_1, i_1) > (p_2, v_1, s_2, i_2)) \iff p_1 < p_2 \lor (p_1 = p_2 \land i_1 < i_2)
\end{align}

\noindent Where the best price for the taker is:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:best_buy}
    & p_{market} = max \{p | (p, v, s, i)\}
\end{align}


\noindent If the quantity for a marketable order can not be fully filled at market price, 
then the taker would suffer from \textbf{price slippage}, if the order is executed. 
If the marketable order can't be filled with limit orders at any price, then the taker order remains partially or fully unfilled. 
Depending on the market order specification, a partially unfilled market order is either executed or canceled.

\section{Slippage}
\label{sec:CLOB_slip}
In general, Slippage occurs when the trade is executed at a different price than what the market suggested at the time where the intent to trade was submitted. 
This was already covered for fully Automated Market Makers in section ~\ref{sec:bs}.

Slippage in the CLOB can occur when a taker order for $x$ shares is not filled entirely at the market price when the order was submitted, 
resulting in a less favorable execution cost for the taker. 
The CLOB is designed to allow this, with the core principle being the taker is guaranteed timely order execution but not price, 
whilst the maker is guaranteed order price but not timely execution. 
We can define the slippage for a taker buying or selling $x$ base assets and getting matched with maker orders M, we have:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:slip}
    Slippage(x,M) = |\sum_{(p, v, s, i) \in M} p*v - p_{market} \cdot x|
\end{align}

\noindent The least limit order $(p, v, s, i) = min\{M\}$ might only be part of a limit order such that another limit order $(p, v',s, i)$ now exists where the previous limit order was $(p, v'',s, i)$ for $v'' = v' + v$ and:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:exec_cost}
    & x = \sum_{(p, v,s, i) \in M} v
\end{align}


\subsection{Slippage Rate on Polymarket}
Using the Orderfilled events emitted by the CTFExchange, 
we can measure the slippage for all 1'443'953 settlements, 
since we have the USDC amount that the taker paid or received in the fill where taker is facing the exchange, 
and the amount of shares and their price for every fill where the maker is facing the taker.
We can now construct a set $A$ of tuples $(x, y, t)$ for every settlement, 
where $x$ is the USDC amount the taker paid or received, $y$ is the slippage and $t$ is the timestamp of the settlement.

\begin{figure}[H] 
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{figures/slip_rate.png}
    \caption{Cumulative Taker USDC Divided by Cumulative Slippage}
    \label{fig:slip_rate}
\end{figure}


In figure ~\ref{fig:slip_rate} we can see that the cumulative taker USDC amount divided by the cumulative slippage up until time $t$ for all settlements,
converges to some value around 100. This can be explained by the law of large numbers, 
if we assume that the $x$ and $y$ values in the tuples in $A$ are i.i.d. and that the expected value of $x$ is finite and non zero, then we have that:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:slip_rate_convergence}
    & \frac{\sum_{(x, y, t) \in A} x}{\sum_{(x, y, t) \in A} y} \xrightarrow{a.s.} \frac{E[x]}{E[y]}
\end{align}


Fitting $y = \alpha x + \beta$ for $y$ as the cumulative Slippage amount and $x$ as the cumulative Taker USDC amount, 
for the 1'412'812 settlements after one day in, to avoid the initial artifact,
we find that $\alpha = 0.00126$ and $\beta = 2.04$ with a standard error $SE = 5.65 \cdot 10^{-6}$ and $R^2 = 0.01765$.
This means that for the aggregate of all settlements we have an extremely good fit, but for individual settlements this is a poor predictor of slippage given the total USDC amount of the taker.

\section{Arbitrage}
\label{sec:arbitrage}

In the prior section we saw that the event ``Which party will win the house 2026?'' had low expected price discrepancies.
However, it is important to also consider that the price for the event itself did not move much, as illustrated by the range of the prices throughout the entire time period in table ~\ref{}, 
and also was not close to being resolved yet.
With the cyclical 15 minute ``Bitcoin up or down?'' event, we can also see how price discrepancies relate to the timeline in the market life cycle.
